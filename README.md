# montagu-bb8
Performs local backup between our servers. This wraps bb8 with Montagu specific 
bits. Essentially this is just the bb8 repo with a config file at the top level.

To use, enter the `bb8` dir and follow instructions in the README there. When
prompted for a SOURCE_CONFIG_PATH, use the `config.json` file in this repo (so
`../config.json` from the `bb8` dir).
